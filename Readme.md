## Overview

The RSA accumulator is a cryptographic tool enabling succinct proofs of membership or non-membership within a set of elements. This repository provides a robust implementation, along with additional scripts for data extraction, benchmarking, and integration with smart contracts for on-chain verification.

## Files and Descriptions

**allFunctions.py:**
Contains essential utility functions reused across scripts for the RSA accumulator's operation.

**data.py:**
Extracts transaction data from blockchain nodes using the Infura API.

**benchmark.py:**
Generates 100,000 random hashes to benchmark accumulation, witness generation, and verification times.

**rsa.py:**
The core script for performing RSA accumulator operations on transaction data retrieved by `data.py`.

**rsa_with_delete.py:**
Extends `rsa.py` with deletion functionality for elements within the accumulator.

**verify.sol:**
A Solidity contract designed for on-chain verification of RSA accumulator proofs.

**checkpoint.py (Experimental):**
Generates and stores RSA accumulator state checkpoints (under development and untested).

**multi.py and multi1.py (Experimental):**
Implement RSA operations using multi-core processing for improved performance.

**witness.json:**
Stores all witnesses generated by `rsa.py`.

**transactions.json:**
Stores retrieved transactions and their corresponding hashes.

**batchRsa.py (Experimental):**
Implements batching functionality for accumulating multiple elements in a single operation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AkshatGada/rsa.git
cd rsa
```

2. Install required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. (Optional) Compile `verify.sol` using a Solidity compiler (e.g., solc or Remix IDE) depending on your blockchain environment.

## Usage

**Running RSA Operations:**

```bash
python rsa.py
```

**Benchmarking:**

```bash
python benchmark.py
```

**Multi-Core Processing (Experimental):**

```bash
python multi.py
```

**On-Chain Verification:**

Deploy the `verify.sol` contract to your chosen blockchain and interact with it for verification.
