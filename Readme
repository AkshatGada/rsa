## Introduction

The RSA Accumulator Project aims to provide a robust and efficient implementation of RSA-based accumulators. This includes support for transaction data extraction, accumulator operations, witness generation, multi-core processing, and on-chain verification using Solidity. The project also includes scripts for benchmarking and checkpointing to facilitate extensive testing and validation of the accumulator's performance and reliability.

## Files and Modules

### allFunctions.py
This file contains the basic boilerplate code for all the functions used in the RSA accumulator. It serves as the foundational module where essential utility functions and core algorithms are defined and implemented.

### data.py
`data.py` is responsible for extracting transaction data from a range of nodes using the Infura API key. This script retrieves and processes the necessary transaction information to be utilized in RSA operations.

### benchmark.py
The `benchmark.py` script is designed to generate 100,000 random hashes. It benchmarks the accumulator’s performance by measuring key metrics such as accumulation time, witness generation time, and verification time.

### rsa.py
This module takes transaction data extracted by `data.py` and performs RSA functions. It’s the main script for executing RSA operations, including the creation of the accumulator and generation of corresponding witnesses.

### rsa_with_delete.py
An extension of the `rsa.py` script, `rsa_with_delete.py` adds functionality to remove elements from the RSA accumulator, allowing for dynamic updates and management of the accumulated set.

### verify.sol
A Solidity file for on-chain verification. This contract allows the RSA accumulator’s proofs and witnesses to be verified within an Ethereum smart contract, facilitating trustless verification on the blockchain.

### checkpoint.py
`checkpoint.py` contains code to generate and store all checkpoints during the RSA operations. **Note:** This script is currently untested and should be used with caution.

### multi.py and multi1.py
These scripts implement the RSA functions using multiple processing cores to optimize performance for large-scale operations. They are designed to utilize multi-core processors, significantly speeding up the accumulation and verification processes.

### witness.json
A JSON file that stores all witnesses generated by the `rsa.py` script. This file is crucial for ensuring the integrity and correctness of the RSA accumulator’s operations by maintaining a log of all generated witnesses.

### transactions.json
This JSON file stores all retrieved transactions and their corresponding hashes. It acts as a record of all the input data used in the RSA operations, enabling traceability and auditability.

### batchRsa.py
`batchRsa.py` introduces batching functionality to the RSA operations, allowing multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously. **Note:** This script is currently untested and should be validated before use in production environments.

## Usage

1. **Extract Data:**
   - Run `data.py` to retrieve and store transaction data.
2. **Perform RSA Operations:**
   - Use `rsa.py` to perform accumulation and witness generation.
3. **Benchmarking:**
   - Execute `benchmark.py` to test the performance of the accumulator.
4. **Multi-Core Processing:**
   - Leverage `multi.py` or `multi1.py` to speed up RSA operations using multiple cores.
5. **On-Chain Verification:**
   - Deploy `verify.sol` to verify RSA proofs on the Ethereum blockchain.
