## Overview
The RSA accumulator is a powerful cryptographic tool that allows for the succinct proof of membership or non-membership within a set of elements. This repository provides a robust implementation of the RSA accumulator, including additional scripts for data extraction, benchmarking, and integration with smart contracts for on-chain verification.

## Files and Descriptions

1. **allFunctions.py**
   - Contains the basic boilerplate of all functions used in the RSA accumulator.
   - This file includes utility functions that are essential for the operation of the accumulator and are reused across multiple scripts.

2. **data.py**
   - Extracts transaction data from a range of blockchain nodes using the Infura API.
   - This script serves as the data retrieval backbone, ensuring that transaction data is readily available for the RSA processes.

3. **benchmark.py**
   - Generates 100,000 random hashes to benchmark various aspects of the RSA accumulator.
   - The benchmarking focuses on measuring accumulation time, witness generation time, and verification time to evaluate performance.

4. **rsa.py**
   - The core script for performing RSA accumulator operations on the transaction data retrieved by `data.py`.
   - Handles the core RSA computations necessary for accumulating elements and generating proofs.

5. **rsa_with_delete.py**
   - Extends the functionality of `rsa.py` by adding the ability to delete elements from the RSA accumulator.
   - Useful for scenarios where elements need to be dynamically managed within the accumulator.

6. **verify.sol**
   - A Solidity contract designed for on-chain verification of RSA accumulator proofs.
   - Enables integration of RSA accumulator functionalities within blockchain environments, providing a means for decentralized verification.

7. **checkpoint.py**
   - Code to generate and store checkpoints of the accumulator's state.
   - Note: This script is still under development and has not yet been fully tested.

8. **multi.py** and **multi1.py**
   - Implement RSA accumulator operations utilizing multiple processing cores for improved performance.
   - These scripts parallelize the RSA computations, making the system more efficient on multi-core processors.

9. **witness.json**
   - Stores all witnesses generated by the `rsa.py` script.
   - Witnesses are used to prove the membership or non-membership of elements within the accumulator.

10. **transactions.json**
    - A storage file for all retrieved transactions and their corresponding hashes.
    - Acts as the local database for transaction data that is processed by the RSA accumulator.

11. **batchRsa.py**
    - Implements batching functionality to accumulate multiple elements in a single operation.
    - Note: This script is experimental and has not been fully tested yet.
